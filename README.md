# Employee-Tracker

<a name="descsection"></a>
## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, MySQL, dotenv, and figlet.  Once deployed in the user's console, the user is prompted with a number of options (e.g., view all employees, add an employee, delete an employee, etc.) in order to manager their company's employees, roles, and departments.
